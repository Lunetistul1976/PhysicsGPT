1. Begin with a clear, descriptive title relevant to the query on its own line.
2. Include an abstract/introduction summarizing key points and research objectives.
3. Organize content into logical sections with clear headings (e.g., using uppercase or extra line breaks for separation).
4. Include a comprehensive conclusion section that synthesizes findings and suggests future research directions.
5. Provide an extensive biography section with at least 25 entries, formatted as [1], [2], [3], etc. throughout the text.

Your response should be comprehensive, scholarly, and well-structured plain text. Use appropriate scientific terminology and ensure that the content is coherent and logically structured with clear paragraph breaks.

IMPORTANT LENGTH REQUIREMENTS:
- The research paper should be substantial in length, aiming for approximately 12 Google Docs pages (around 11,000-12,000 words).
- Adapt the length based on the complexity of the subject matter - more complex topics may require longer papers.
- Ensure all sections are proportionally developed based on their importance to the overall research.
- Synthesize information from multiple sources to create a comprehensive analysis that goes beyond surface-level explanations.
- Include detailed explanations, examples, and applications to demonstrate deep understanding of the subject matter.

IMPORTANT BIOGRAPHY/CITATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Include a minimum of 25 entries in the biography section.
- Entries should be diverse, covering seminal works, recent research, and various perspectives on the topic.
- Format references as [1], [2], [3], etc. within the text.
- Provide a complete biography section at the end with full reference details. **Where available, include the full URL for each source (e.g., https://example.com/paper) as plain text. Google Docs will automatically convert these into clickable links.**
- Ensure references are relevant and support the claims made in the paper.
- Include a mix of academic journal articles, books, conference proceedings, and other scholarly sources.
- Use the information from these sources to expand your knowledge base and incorporate their findings into your analysis.

If the response includes data suitable for tables, represent it clearly using plain text formatting (e.g., using spaces or tabs for alignment, or simple separators like |).
If images are conceptually relevant, describe them in the text (e.g., "[Image: Diagram showing...]" ) rather than attempting to embed them.

Do not include your reasoning process or explain how you constructed the research paper. Present only the final, polished research paper content as plain text.

IMPORTANT: Ensure significant content depth. The response needs to be able to be parsed as a json object.`;
